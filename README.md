# Key Generator

Title: CD Key Generator

Description: Create a program which generates keys for an application that you may put on a
CD. Classic example would be the keys you use for installation of a major software product from
Microsoft or Adobe. Have the user specify the length of keys and the types of characters they
can use in the key (only letters, letters & numbers, just numbers, any special characters). It will
then generate a random key value that can also be verified. In addition, create the mechanism
for validating the generated key.
